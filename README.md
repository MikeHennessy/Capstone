# Capstone
All software for the LMU Sustainability Capstone 2024-2025, designing an automated solar panel that tracks the sun.

The repository is split into four sections:
- Connection between Actuator and Arduino
- Connection between Raspberry Pi and Arduino
- LCD screen and UI
- APIs and Logic

Abstract: This report outlines the design and implementation of an automated sun-tracking solar panel system for Loyola Marymount University's campus. The project aims to improve the efficiency of existing static solar panels by designing a new system of sun-tracking panels at a low cost and high power efficiency. The report covers the project's background, including LMU's current solar energy infrastructure and sustainability goals. It analyzes the advantages of automated solar panels over static ones, presenting comparative studies that demonstrate significant increases in energy capture. The report details the calculations for solar angle tracking, along with the mechanics and electronics for how the tracking device works. The design specifications focus on using linear actuators for panel movement and a Raspberry Pi for system control. The report also addresses considerations for weather-dependent operation and integration with existing infrastructure. This project aligns with LMU's sustainability initiatives and aims to increase clean energy production on campus while providing a cost-effective solution for upgrading existing solar installations.
